# AiOnE
An all in one cross platform resource application for enterprise organizations, This application aims at achieving following goals for an enterprise organisation:
* Unify enterprise organization facilities for employees in a segregated and comprehensive manner.
* Replace queue-based physical resolution with readily available information on facilities.
* Significantly reduce query resolution time through quick access to general information and data.
* Minimize redundancy by publishing essential information that every employee should know.
* Streamline employee access to a centralized resource platform.
* Enhance efficiency by eliminating the need for employees to seek information from physical authorities.
* Improve overall employee experience by providing detailed and easily accessible facility information.

### Future Roadmap ###

This application is currently using FaaS as backend. With the limited open source features integrated, this application is scalable upto a very specific limit. If the usage is considered for bigger enterprises, with realtime data and current processing speed, then it would require some advance database storage systems, faster data processing on request of the user and even a better security measure around the employee data. This B2B application can be implemented by any organization willing to pool their resources into a single platform making each and every facility easily accessible for their employees.
